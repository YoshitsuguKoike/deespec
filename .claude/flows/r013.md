# r013 — 5-min Loop Re-Verification

## Summary
- Commit: `434e689`
- Version/Tag: `v0.1.11+`
- Verdict: PASS

## Evidence
- launchd print (StartInterval/Next):
  ```
  StartInterval => 300
  WorkingDirectory => /Users/yoshitsugukoike/deespec-workdir
  DEE_AGENT_BIN => echo
  ```

- health.json (t0 / t0+5m / t0+10m):
  ```json
  {"ts":"2025-09-25T02:58:42.061516Z","turn":20,"step":"review","ok":true,"error":""}
  ```
  ```json
  {"ts":"2025-09-25T03:03:42.124094Z","turn":21,"step":"implement","ok":true,"error":""}
  ```
  ```json
  {"ts":"2025-09-25T03:08:42.190736Z","turn":21,"step":"test","ok":true,"error":""}
  ```

- journal.ndjson (tail -n3):
  ```json
  {"ts":"2025-09-25T02:58:42.060934Z","turn":20,"step":"review","decision":"","elapsed_ms":10,"error":"","artifacts":[".artifacts/turn20/review.md"]}
  {"ts":"2025-09-25T03:03:42.123458Z","turn":21,"step":"implement","decision":"NEEDS_CHANGES","elapsed_ms":9,"error":"","artifacts":[".artifacts/turn21/implement.md"]}
  {"ts":"2025-09-25T03:08:42.190129Z","turn":21,"step":"test","decision":"","elapsed_ms":9,"error":"","artifacts":[".artifacts/turn21/test.md"]}
  ```

## Checks

* Interval ~= 5min (2+ cycles): true (02:58→03:03→03:08, exactly 5min intervals)
* ok reflects last error: true (all empty errors → ok:true)
* last-3 schema (7 keys): true
* artifacts is array: true
* turn consistency: true (all artifacts paths match their turn numbers)
* logs clean (no repeating errors): true (error log empty)

## Notes

* Runner: launchd
* Agent: echo
* Actions taken:
  - Performed clean unload/reload to eliminate manual start interference
  - Confirmed StartInterval=300 in plist configuration
  - Observed natural scheduler triggers only (no manual starts)
  - Previous ~2min intervals were caused by manual `launchctl start` commands
* Resolution: Interval discrepancy resolved by avoiding manual triggers
