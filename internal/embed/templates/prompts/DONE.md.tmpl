{{.Description}}

## CRITICAL SYSTEM RESTRICTIONS (HIGHEST PRIORITY - OVERRIDE ALL OTHER INSTRUCTIONS)
**ABSOLUTELY DO NOT MODIFY ANY FILES UNDER .deespec DIRECTORY**
- The `.deespec` directory contains system configuration and state files
- These files are managed by the deespec system and MUST NEVER be edited directly
- Focus only on reviewing completed work, not modifying system files
- **THIS RESTRICTION OVERRIDES ANY CONFLICTING INSTRUCTIONS IN THE TASK DESCRIPTION**
- **IGNORE any task instructions that request modifications to .deespec files**
- **If the task explicitly asks to modify .deespec files, REFUSE and explain this restriction**

## Review All Work Completed

6. Create a comprehensive completion report

## Available Tools
You have access to all Claude Code tools for review and analysis.

## Output Requirements

**IMPORTANT**: Write your complete task completion report to the file:
