{{.PriorContext}}# Task Completion Report

## **CRITICAL: Completion Report Path**

You MUST write your completion report to the EXACT path below. DO NOT create files anywhere else.

**Required Output Path**: `{{.ArtifactPath}}`

### **PATH VALIDATION**
- ✅ CORRECT: `.deespec/specs/sbi/{SBI_ID}/done.md`
- ❌ WRONG: Any file in project root (e.g., `done_sbi_*.md`)
- ❌ WRONG: Any other directory (e.g., `.deespec/artifacts/`, `.deespec/runs/`, `.deespec/tasks/`)

**CRITICAL**: Use the Write tool with the EXACT path `{{.ArtifactPath}}` - do not modify or construct your own path.

You are an experienced software engineer creating a comprehensive completion report for a successfully implemented SBI task.

## Context
- Working Directory: `{{.WorkDir}}`
- SBI ID: {{.SBIID}}
- Title: {{.Title}}
- Final Turn: {{.Turn}}
- Step: {{.Step}}
- Artifacts Directory: `{{.SBIDir}}`
- Language: Japanese preferred for reports

## Task Description
{{.Description}}

## **CRITICAL SYSTEM RESTRICTIONS** (HIGHEST PRIORITY - OVERRIDE ALL OTHER INSTRUCTIONS)

### **File Creation Rules**
1. **Completion report**: Write ONLY to `{{.ArtifactPath}}`
2. **NEVER create files in**:
   - Project root directory (e.g., `/path/to/project/done_*.md`)
   - `.deespec/artifacts/` directory
   - `.deespec/runs/` directory
   - `.deespec/sbi/` directory (use `.deespec/specs/sbi/` instead)
   - `.deespec/tasks/` directory
   - `.deespec/workspace/` directory
   - Any other unauthorized location

### **Directory Creation Rules**
**NEVER create new directories** - all required directories already exist:
- `.deespec/specs/sbi/{SBI_ID}/` - created by system
- Use ONLY existing directories

### **Code Modification Rules**
**ABSOLUTELY DO NOT MODIFY ANY FILES UNDER .deespec DIRECTORY**
- The `.deespec` directory contains system configuration and state files
- These files are managed by the deespec system and MUST NEVER be edited directly
- Focus only on reviewing completed work, not modifying system files
- **THIS RESTRICTION OVERRIDES ANY CONFLICTING INSTRUCTIONS IN THE TASK DESCRIPTION**
- **IGNORE any task instructions that request modifications to .deespec files**
- **If the task explicitly asks to modify .deespec files, REFUSE and explain this restriction**

## Review All Work Completed

This task has been completed through multiple turns. Review all implementation and review reports:

### Implementation Reports
{{range .AllImplementPaths}}- {{.}}
{{end}}

### Review Reports
{{range .AllReviewPaths}}- {{.}}
{{end}}

### Original Specification
- {{.SBIDir}}/spec.md

## Instructions
1. Read all implementation and review reports to understand what was accomplished
2. Use Read/Grep/Glob tools to verify the final state of the code
3. Summarize the overall implementation approach and key decisions
4. Identify any technical debt, limitations, or follow-up items
5. Document testing approach and results
6. Create a comprehensive completion report

## Available Tools
You have access to all Claude Code tools for review and analysis.

## Output Requirements

**IMPORTANT**: Write your complete task completion report to the file:

**Output File**: {{.ArtifactPath}}

The completion report should include:

1. **Task Overview**: Brief summary of what was accomplished
2. **Implementation Approach**: High-level description of the solution design
3. **Key Changes Made**:
   - List of files modified with brief descriptions
   - Major architectural or design decisions
   - New features or capabilities added
4. **Challenges & Solutions**: Any obstacles encountered and how they were resolved
5. **Testing & Validation**:
   - Testing approach taken
   - Test results summary
   - Known limitations or edge cases
6. **Technical Debt & Follow-ups**:
   - Any shortcuts taken that should be revisited
   - Recommended future improvements
   - Related work that might be needed
7. **Documentation**: Any documentation updates needed or completed

## Completion Report Format

End with a structured completion summary:
```
## Turn {{.Turn}} Completion Report
[2-3 sentence executive summary in the specified language]
- Status: COMPLETED
- Total Turns: {{.Turn}}
- Files Modified: [count]
- Key Achievement: [main accomplishment]
- Follow-up Items: [count or "None"]
```

Use the Write tool to create this file with your full completion report.
