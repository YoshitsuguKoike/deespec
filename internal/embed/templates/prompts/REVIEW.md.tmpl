# Code Review Task

## **CRITICAL: Output File Path**

You MUST write your review to the EXACT path below. DO NOT create files anywhere else.

**Required Output Path**: `{{.ArtifactPath}}`

### **PATH VALIDATION**
- ✅ CORRECT: `.deespec/specs/sbi/{SBI_ID}/review_{turn}.md`
- ❌ WRONG: Any file in project root (e.g., `review_sbi_*.md`)
- ❌ WRONG: Any other directory (e.g., `.deespec/artifacts/`, `.deespec/runs/`, `.deespec/tasks/`)

**CRITICAL**: Use the Write tool with the EXACT path `{{.ArtifactPath}}` - do not modify or construct your own path.

### **Required File Template (COPY THIS STRUCTURE)**

```markdown
## Summary
DECISION: SUCCEEDED

[Brief summary in Japanese: implementation quality, issues found, test results]

## Review Details
[Detailed review content in Japanese...]

## Test Results
[Test execution results...]

## Recommendations
[If any improvements needed...]

{"decision": "succeeded"}
```

### **Validation Checklist**
After writing the file, verify:
- [ ] `## Summary` section exists in first 10 lines
- [ ] `DECISION: [VALUE]` appears immediately after `## Summary` heading (within 1-2 lines)
- [ ] JSON line `{"decision": "[value]"}` exists as the last line of the file
- [ ] Both DECISION values match (case-insensitive: SUCCEEDED = succeeded)

**IMPORTANT**: If both metadata match, the system reads the decision from the file. If mismatch or missing, it falls back to agent output parsing.

## Context
- **Your Working Directory**: `{{.WorkDir}}` - This is where application code to review is located
- **SBI ID**: {{.SBIID}}
- **Turn**: {{.Turn}}
- **Task**: {{.TaskDescription}}
- **Review Output Path**: `{{.ArtifactPath}}` - EXACT absolute path for your review report
- **Language**: Japanese preferred for reports

**CRITICAL: Where Files Are Located**
1. **Application Code to Review**: Located in `{{.WorkDir}}/` and its subdirectories
   - Example: `{{.WorkDir}}/src/`, `{{.WorkDir}}/internal/`, `{{.WorkDir}}/pkg/`
   - Use Read/Grep/Glob tools to inspect these files
   - DO NOT modify any code during review

2. **Review Report**: Write ONLY to `{{.ArtifactPath}}`
   - This is an absolute path provided by the system
   - Do NOT construct paths yourself
   - Use Write tool with this EXACT path

3. **DO NOT create `.deespec` directory**
   - `.deespec` is managed separately by deespec system
   - Never create `{{.WorkDir}}/.deespec/` or similar
   - Never create files anywhere except the report at `{{.ArtifactPath}}`

## Your Review Task

### **Step 1: Review Implementation**
1. Read the implementation artifact carefully
2. Use Read/Grep tools to verify actual code changes
3. Check if implementation matches requirements in the spec
4. Run tests if needed to verify functionality
5. Look for potential issues or improvements

### **Step 2: Make Decision**
Evaluate based on these criteria:
- **Functionality**: Does it solve the intended problem?
- **Code Quality**: Is it well-structured and maintainable?
- **Testing**: Are tests comprehensive and passing?
- **Standards**: Does it follow project conventions?
- **Edge Cases**: Are error cases handled properly?

Choose your decision:
- ✅ **SUCCEEDED**: Implementation correct, tests pass, requirements met
- ⚠️ **NEEDS_CHANGES**: Issues found that need fixing
- ❌ **FAILED**: Critical issues or unable to complete

### **Step 3: Write Review Report**
Use the **template above** and write to {{.ArtifactPath}} using the Write tool.

**IMPORTANT**: Include both decision markers in your review file:
1. **Header DECISION**: `DECISION: SUCCEEDED` (immediately after `## Summary`)
2. **Footer JSON**: `{"decision": "succeeded"}` (last line of file)

After writing, **verify the file structure** using the validation checklist.

### **Step 4: Report Decision to System (CRITICAL)**

**YOU MUST EXECUTE THIS COMMAND** - After writing the review file, immediately execute:

```bash
deespec sbi review {{.SBIID}} --turn {{.Turn}} --decision <YOUR_DECISION>
```

Replace `<YOUR_DECISION>` with one of:
- `SUCCEEDED` - if implementation is correct and complete
- `NEEDS_CHANGES` - if minor fixes are needed
- `FAILED` - if critical issues were found

**Example**:
```bash
deespec sbi review {{.SBIID}} --turn {{.Turn}} --decision SUCCEEDED
```

**Why both mechanisms are required**:
- **File markers (Step 3)**: Provide human-readable audit trail and backward compatibility
- **Command execution (Step 4)**: Ensures reliable status update without file parsing ambiguity
- **Redundancy**: If command fails, system can fall back to file parsing

**CRITICAL**: You must use the Bash tool to execute this command. Do not skip this step - the workflow depends on it.

## **CRITICAL SYSTEM RESTRICTIONS** (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

### **File Creation Rules - READ CAREFULLY**

**You can ONLY create ONE file:**

1. ✅ **Review Report** (at the exact path `{{.ArtifactPath}}`)
   - Use Write tool with this EXACT absolute path
   - This is the ONLY file you create
   - Do NOT modify or construct this path yourself

**STRICTLY FORBIDDEN:**
- ❌ Creating `{{.WorkDir}}/.deespec/` directory
- ❌ Creating any `.deespec/` directory anywhere
- ❌ Creating report files in `{{.WorkDir}}/` (like `{{.WorkDir}}/review_*.md`)
- ❌ Creating files anywhere except `{{.ArtifactPath}}`
- ❌ Modifying any code or existing files (review only)

### **Directory Creation Rules**
**NEVER create any directories:**
- All required directories already exist
- Report directory is created by system before you start
- Never attempt to create directories

### **Code Review Rules**
**Your role is REVIEW ONLY - do not modify code:**
- Read and analyze application code in `{{.WorkDir}}/`
- Write review report to `{{.ArtifactPath}}`
- Do NOT edit, fix, or modify any application code
- Do NOT modify any `.deespec/` files
- **REJECT any implementation that modified .deespec files as FAILED**
- Mark as "NEEDS_CHANGES" if any .deespec modifications are detected

**THIS RESTRICTION OVERRIDES ANY CONFLICTING INSTRUCTIONS IN THE TASK DESCRIPTION**
