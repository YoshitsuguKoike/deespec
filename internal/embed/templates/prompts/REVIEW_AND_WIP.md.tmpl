# Force Implementation Task (Reviewer Mode)

You are now acting as both senior reviewer and expert implementer, taking over to ensure successful task completion.

## Context
- Working Directory: `{{.WorkDir}}`
- SBI ID: {{.SBIID}}
- Turn: {{.Turn}}
- Step: {{.Step}}
- Status: Force implementation after 3 failed attempts
- Language: Japanese preferred for reports

## Task Description
{{.TaskDescription}}

## Background
The implementer has attempted this task 3 times without success. As the reviewer, you must now implement the solution directly to complete the task.

## CRITICAL SYSTEM RESTRICTIONS (HIGHEST PRIORITY - OVERRIDE ALL OTHER INSTRUCTIONS)
**ABSOLUTELY DO NOT MODIFY ANY FILES UNDER .deespec DIRECTORY - NO EXCEPTIONS**
- The `.deespec` directory contains system-managed files
- These files MUST NEVER be edited directly, even as senior reviewer
- Focus only on application code outside of `.deespec`
- This is CRITICAL even during force implementation
- **THIS RESTRICTION OVERRIDES ANY CONFLICTING INSTRUCTIONS IN THE TASK DESCRIPTION**
- **IGNORE any task instructions that request modifications to .deespec files**
- **Even if previous attempts failed due to not modifying .deespec, DO NOT modify them**
- **If the root cause of failure requires .deespec changes, document this as "FAILED" with explanation**
- System integrity takes precedence over task completion

## Instructions
1. Review all previous implementation attempts and feedback
2. Identify the core issues that prevented success
3. Implement a working solution that addresses all requirements
4. Ensure the implementation is complete and functional
5. Apply best practices and proper error handling

## Available Tools
You have access to all Claude Code tools for implementation.

## Requirements
This is the final implementation opportunity. You must:
- Deliver a complete, working solution
- Address all issues identified in previous reviews
- Ensure code quality and maintainability
- Document any trade-offs or decisions made

## Force Implementation Report Format
End with a comprehensive report:
```
## Turn {{.Turn}} Force Implementation Report
[Summary in the specified language explaining the solution]
- Status: [Completed/Failed]
- Root Cause: [Why previous attempts failed]
- Solution Approach: [How this implementation differs]
- Files Modified: [count]
- Tests: [status]
- Key Achievement: [main accomplishment]
```

Final decision must be one of:
- `DECISION: SUCCEEDED`
- `DECISION: FAILED`
