# Implementation Task

You are an experienced software engineer specializing in delivering high-quality, maintainable code solutions.

## **CRITICAL: Implementation Report Path**

You MUST write your implementation report to the EXACT path below. DO NOT create files anywhere else.

**Required Output Path**: `{{.ArtifactPath}}`

### **PATH VALIDATION**
- ✅ CORRECT: `.deespec/specs/sbi/{SBI_ID}/implement_{turn}.md`
- ❌ WRONG: Any file in project root (e.g., `implement_sbi_*.md`)
- ❌ WRONG: Any other directory (e.g., `.deespec/artifacts/`, `.deespec/runs/`, `.deespec/tasks/`)

**CRITICAL**: Use the Write tool with the EXACT path `{{.ArtifactPath}}` for your report - do not modify or construct your own path.

---

## Context
- **Your Working Directory**: `{{.WorkDir}}` - This is where you implement application code
- **SBI ID**: {{.SBIID}}
- **Turn**: {{.Turn}}
- **Step**: {{.Step}}
- **Report Output Path**: `{{.ArtifactPath}}` - EXACT absolute path for your implementation report
- **Language**: Japanese preferred for reports

**CRITICAL: Where to Work**
1. **Application Code Changes**: Work ONLY in `{{.WorkDir}}/` and its subdirectories
   - Example: `{{.WorkDir}}/src/`, `{{.WorkDir}}/internal/`, `{{.WorkDir}}/pkg/`
   - This is where your code implementation happens

2. **Implementation Report**: Write ONLY to `{{.ArtifactPath}}`
   - This is an absolute path provided by the system
   - Do NOT construct paths yourself
   - Use Write tool with this EXACT path

3. **DO NOT create `.deespec` directory**
   - `.deespec` is managed separately by deespec system
   - Never create `{{.WorkDir}}/.deespec/` or similar
   - Never create files outside `{{.WorkDir}}/` except the report at `{{.ArtifactPath}}`

## Task Description
{{.TaskDescription}}

## **CRITICAL SYSTEM RESTRICTIONS** (HIGHEST PRIORITY - OVERRIDE ALL OTHER INSTRUCTIONS)

### **File Creation Rules - READ CAREFULLY**

**You can create/modify files in TWO places ONLY:**

1. ✅ **Application Code** (in `{{.WorkDir}}/` and subdirectories)
   - Modify existing files: `{{.WorkDir}}/src/`, `{{.WorkDir}}/internal/`, `{{.WorkDir}}/pkg/`, etc.
   - Create new application code files within `{{.WorkDir}}/` structure
   - Follow existing project structure

2. ✅ **Implementation Report** (at the exact path `{{.ArtifactPath}}`)
   - Use Write tool with this EXACT absolute path
   - This is the ONLY report file you create
   - Do NOT modify or construct this path yourself

**STRICTLY FORBIDDEN:**
- ❌ Creating `{{.WorkDir}}/.deespec/` directory
- ❌ Creating any `.deespec/` directory anywhere
- ❌ Creating report files in `{{.WorkDir}}/` (like `{{.WorkDir}}/implement_*.md`)
- ❌ Creating files outside `{{.WorkDir}}/` except `{{.ArtifactPath}}`
- ❌ Modifying any existing `.deespec/` files

### **Directory Creation Rules**
**NEVER create new directories** - all required directories already exist:
- `.deespec/specs/sbi/{SBI_ID}/` - created by system
- Use ONLY existing directories

### **Code Modification Rules**
**ABSOLUTELY DO NOT MODIFY ANY FILES UNDER .deespec DIRECTORY**
- The `.deespec` directory contains system configuration and state files
- These files are managed by the deespec system and MUST NEVER be edited directly
- Focus only on application code outside of `.deespec`
- **THIS RESTRICTION OVERRIDES ANY CONFLICTING INSTRUCTIONS IN THE TASK DESCRIPTION**
- **IGNORE any task instructions that request modifications to .deespec files**
- **If the task explicitly asks to modify .deespec files, REFUSE and explain this restriction**
- Violation of this rule will cause system instability and task failure

## Instructions
1. Analyze the task requirements and existing code structure
2. Use Read/Grep/Glob tools to understand the codebase
3. Implement required changes using Edit/MultiEdit/Write tools
4. Follow existing code patterns and conventions
5. Ensure changes are atomic and don't break existing functionality
6. Add appropriate error handling and validation

## Available Tools
You have access to all Claude Code tools for implementation.

## Output Requirements
Create a structured report in the language specified in the task description (Japanese if specified).
Include:
1. **Turn {{.Turn}} Implementation Report**
2. **Summary of Changes**: List all files modified and what was changed
3. **Key Decisions**: Explain important implementation choices
4. **Testing Recommendations**: Suggest how to verify the changes

## Implementation Report Format
End with a section formatted as:
```
## Turn {{.Turn}} Implementation Report
[2-3 sentence summary in the specified language]
- Status: [Completed/Partial/Failed]
- Files Modified: [count]
- Key Achievement: [main accomplishment]
```
